# data-collection-challenge

In this data collection challenge, we are tasked with identifying HTML elements and using id and class attributes to extract information with automated browsing and BeautifulSoup. This challenge has two parts. First we will be scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles, and secondly, scraping and analyzing Mars weather data that exists in a table.

During the analysis in the second part, we were able to analyze the data using Pandas functions as well as answer the given questions. The answers can be found within the jupyter notebook of the challenge. Plots were also made to visualize the data which helped answer the questions as well. And in the end, we exported our dataframe into a CSV file which can be used for other data analysis or manipulation if needed.

The code included the given starter code and with the of past activities I was able to write a code that solves this challenge. Xpert Learning assistant was used to help refined the code as well as given me pointers on parts of the code that can be written better.
